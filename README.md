# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project:

Our client, Steve, requests an expanded green-stock data set to include the entire stockmart in 2017 and 2018. An intial code was provided and in order to provide the data as Steve requests, we have refactored the code to ensure the following: 
  1. Maintain the same efunctionality of the original code
  2. Improve the performance of the VBA macro
  3. Provide an analysis that identifies positive and negative returns for stocks listed. 

## Results:
Refactoring the provided code did allow for a more efficent performing code. Ultimately, the 2017 dataset improved in performance from .09375 seconds to 0.0625 seconds. Similarly, the refactored code performed with less time - from 0.109375 seconds to 0.0625 seconds - for the 2018 worksheet. 

## Summary:

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

One major advantage to refactoring code is saving time and work for your machine. The process of refactoring allowed for consideration of other issues and possible recoding of data types and adjustment of if-then statements. Some of the disadvantages included not understanding the expectation of the code - attempting to guess as to what the comments mean. 

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Forunately, this code was well documented but it may be useful to evaluate the dataset for errors in data, mixed data types in one column, etc. One con that can be applied to the original code is the expectation of the formatting. There was not much direction on how to format the cells so I left it as is.
